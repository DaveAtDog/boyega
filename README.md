Now with sound! Thanks [Seth Broweleit](https://github.com/getsetbro).

Add a little "Force Awakens" to your siteâ€¦

That's right... Now you can add a popup stormtrooper to your site.

Example: http://www.defmech.com

Simply add: ```<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/DaveAtDog/boyega/master/js/boyega.js"></script>``` to your HTML doc.
